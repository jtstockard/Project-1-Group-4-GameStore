# Project-1-Group-4-GameStore

## Project Goal

The user will be able to search and filter consoles, games, t-shirts, and invoices by certain features. Features will include searches by manufacturer, size, color, and titles. This is the current MVP for this to make sure back end compatibility is used for a RESTful API.
